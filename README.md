Introduction
Citation sentiment analysis evaluates the polarity (positive, neutral, or negative) of citation text in research papers. Traditional citation metrics like citation count fail to capture the qualitative aspect of citations. This project introduces sentiment analysis to address this limitation and ranks research papers using a novel metric called the M-index.

Key Contributions:

Classification of citation sentiments using machine learning models.
Embedding techniques such as Node2Vec and BERT for feature representation.
Ranking of papers using the combined quantitative and qualitative aspects of citations.
